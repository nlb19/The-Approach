# The Approach

The Approach began as a simple workout tracker for climbers, but with inspiration and resources from other projects has become much more than that. Now the goal is to have a centralized logbook for all types of climbing and workout activities paired with analytics and planning tools to give users the tools to optimize training.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. It has not been published on the web anywhere at the moment but can be run locally.

## Reflection

  - This is a passion project for me which has allowed me to explore different technologies through the lense of this project.
  - I have been experimenting with a different tech stack than I am comfortable with. I also haven't been able to dedicate full effort up until this point.
  - One main obstacle that I am facing is managing logbook syncs across multiple platorms. The format is slightly different for the boards than I want it to be for data processing in my app.
  - Technologies:
    - Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
    - Backend: Golang, Gin, MongoDB
